/**
 * Implement an iterator to flatten a 2d vector.
 * For example,
 * Given 2d vector =
 * [
 *   [1,2],
 *   [3],
 *   [4,5,6]
 * ]
 * By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,2,3,4,5,6].
 * Hint:
 * How many variables do you need to keep track?
 * Two variables is all you need. Try with x and y.
 * Beware of empty rows. It could be the first few rows.
 * To write correct code, think about the invariant to maintain. What is it?
 * The invariant is x and y must always point to a valid point in the 2d vector. Should you maintain your invariant ahead of time or right when you need it?
 * Not sure? Think about how you would implement hasNext(). Which is more complex?
 * Common logic in two different places should be refactored into a common method.
 * Follow up:
 * As an added challenge, try to code it using only iterators in C++ or iterators in Java.
