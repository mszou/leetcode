/**
 * Given a string, determine if a permutation of the string could form a palindrome.
 * For example,
 * "code" -> False, "aab" -> True, "carerac" -> True.
 * Hint:
 * Consider the palindromes of odd vs even length. What difference do you notice?
 * Count the frequency of each character.
 * If each character occurs even number of times, then it must be a palindrome. How about character which occurs odd number of times?
