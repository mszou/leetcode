/**
 * There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n - 1.
 * Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]
 * Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?
 * For example:
 * 2, [[1,0]]
 * There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
 * 2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
 * There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
 * Note:
 * The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
 * Hints:
 * This problem is equivalent to finding if a cycle exists in a directed graph. If a cycle exists, no topological ordering exists and therefore it will be impossible to take all courses.
 * Topological Sort via DFS - A great video tutorial (21 minutes) on Coursera explaining the basic concepts of Topological Sort.
 * Topological sort could also be done via BFS.
