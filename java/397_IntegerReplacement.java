/**
 * Given a positive integer n and you can do operations as follow:
 * If n is even, replace n with n/2.
 * If n is odd, you can replace n with either n + 1 or n - 1.
 * What is the minimum number of replacements needed for n to become 1?
 * Example 1:
 * Input:
 * 8
 * Output:
 * 3
 * Explanation:
 * 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
 * Example 2:
 * Input:
 * 7
 * Output:
 * 4
 * Explanation:
 * 7 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
 * or
 * 7 -> 6 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1
