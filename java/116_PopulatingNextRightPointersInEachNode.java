/**
 * Given a binary tree
 *     struct TreeLinkNode {
 *       TreeLinkNode *left;
 *       TreeLinkNode *right;
 *       TreeLinkNode *next;
 *     }
 * Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.
 * Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.
 * Note:
 * You may only use constant extra space.
 * You may assume that it is a perfect binary tree (ie, all leaves are at the same level, and every parent has two children).
 * For example,
 * Given the following perfect binary tree,
 *          1
 *        /  \
 *       2    3
 *      / \  / \
 *     4  5  6  7
 * After calling your function, the tree should look like:
 *          1 -> NULL
 *        /  \
 *       2 -> 3 -> NULL
 *      / \  / \
 *     4->5->6->7 -> NULL
