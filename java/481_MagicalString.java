/**
 * A magical string S consists of only '1' and '2' and obeys the following rules:
 * The string S is magical because concatenating the number of contiguous occurrences of characters '1' and '2' generates the string S itself.
 * The first few elements of string S is the following: S = "1221121221221121122……"
 * If we group the consecutive '1's and '2's in S, it will be:
 * 1 22 11 2 1 22 1 22 11 2 11 22 ......
 * and the occurrences of '1's or '2's in each group are:
 * 1 2	2 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 ......
 * You can see that the occurrence sequence above is the S itself.
 * Given an integer N as input, return the number of '1's in the first N number in the magical string S.
 * Note: N will not exceed 100,000.
 * Example 1:
 * Input: 6
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The first 6 elements of magical string S is "12211" and it contains three 1's, so return 3.
