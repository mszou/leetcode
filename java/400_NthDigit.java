/**
 * Find the nth digit of the infinite integer sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ...
 * Note:
 * n is positive and will fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer (n < 231).
 * Example 1:
 * Input:
 * 3
 * Output:
 * 3
 * Example 2:
 * Input:
 * 11
 * Output:
 * 0
 * Explanation:
 * The 11th digit of the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ... is a 0, which is part of the number 10.
