/**
 * Given n points on a 2D plane, find if there is such a line parallel to y-axis that reflect the given set of points.
 * Example 1:
 * Given points = [[1,1],[-1,1]], return true.
 * Example 2:
 * Given points = [[1,1],[-1,-1]], return false.
 * Follow up:
 * Could you do better than O(n2)?
 * Hint:
 * Find the smallest and largest x-value for all points.
 * If there is a line then it should be at x = (minX + maxX) / 2.
 * For each point, make sure that it has a reflected point in the opposite side.
 */

public class Solution {
	// idea: if there is such a line, it can only be x = (minX + maxX) / 2, or x = avgX
	// so compute that avg and check if every point has a reflected point in the set.
	// When compare self-defined class other than basic types, we need to override equals(Object o)
	// and hashCode() because we want to compare the value of two objects, not the mem address.
	// * (multiply 31 is often used in overriding hashCode because 31 is an odd prime. If it were even
	// and the multiplication overflowed, information would be lost, as multiplication by 2 is equivalent
	// to bit shifting. The advantage of using a prime is less clear, but it is traditional. A nice
	// property of 31 is that the multiplication can be replaced by a shift and a subtraction for better
	// performance: 31 * i == (i << 5) - i. Modern VMs do this sort of optimization automatically.)
