/**
 * Assume you have an array of length n initialized with all 0's and are given k update operations.
 * Each operation is represented as a triplet: [startIndex, endIndex, inc] which increments each element of subarray A[startIndex ... endIndex] (startIndex and endIndex inclusive) with inc.
 * Return the modified array after all k operations were executed.
 * Example:
 * Given:
 *     length = 5,
 *     updates = [
 *         [1,  3,  2],
 *         [2,  4,  3],
 *         [0,  2, -2]
 *     ]
 * Output:
 *     [-2, 0, 3, 5, 3]
 * Explanation:
 * Initial state:
 * [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ]
 * After applying operation [1, 3, 2]:
 * [ 0, 2, 2, 2, 0 ]
 * After applying operation [2, 4, 3]:
 * [ 0, 2, 5, 5, 3 ]
 * After applying operation [0, 2, -2]:
 * [-2, 0, 3, 5, 3 ]
 * Hint:
 * Thinking of using advanced data structures? You are thinking it too complicated.
 * For each update operation, do you really need to update all elements between i and j?
 * Update only the first and end element is sufficient.
 * The optimal time complexity is O(k + n) and uses O(1) extra space.
